#Pre-vizArt
The application of this project is to previz prompt-based generated artwork images using an AR mobile application. This is the fist step to this idea. In this current version, there are 5 styles of images you can generate. 

1. Anime    
2. Pixel
3. Cubist
4. Disney Cartoon
5. Storyboard

I aim to extend this project further by adding many more styles of images and complete building the mobile application. You can access the current prototype version here 18.222.170.46:1000. It's hosted on AWS, so I may take it down in the future. Please note that there may be some bugs that don't cause images to generate, please give a different prompt if this happens.
